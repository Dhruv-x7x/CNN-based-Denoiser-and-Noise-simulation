# CNN-based-Denoiser-and-Noise-simulation

---

This was done for purely educational purposes. I used various resources to compile all the information in the notebook. It serves as a basic tutorial to CNNs and PyTorch via a simple project. The goal is to add noise to clean images and then train a CNN model to denoise them.
